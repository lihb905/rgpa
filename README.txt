1. Our experiments were run in Choco 4.10.8. The environment is JDK8.

2. The source codes of our GPA and RGPA are attached. We made some changes in some of the original source file of Choco including org.chocosolver.solver.search.strategy.selectors.variables.ActivityBased.java, org.chocosolver.solver.search.loop.move.MoveRestart.java and org.chocosolver.parser.flatzinc.ast.FGoal.java. The modified files are included in the org.chocosolver package. To run our code, you should download the Choco 4.10.8 and the parsers, then overwrite the modified files. You can run the main function in CommandLine.java to use our algorithm.
